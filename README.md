# L-99: Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems (Solved in Elixir)

Welcome to the **L-99 Elixir Solutions** repository! This project is a collection of solutions to the famous [Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/), rewritten in **Elixir**. These problems are a great way to learn and practice functional programming concepts.

## About the L-99 Problems

The L-99 problems are a set of programming challenges designed to teach and test functional programming skills. Originally written for Lisp, these problems have been adapted to many other languages, including Elixir. They cover a variety of topics, such as:

- List processing
- Arithmetic
- Logic and codes
- Trees
- Graphs
- Miscellaneous problems

## Why Elixir?

Elixir is a functional, concurrent programming language built on the Erlang VM. Its expressive syntax and powerful abstractions make it an excellent choice for solving functional programming problems. By working through these problems in Elixir, you'll gain:

- A deeper understanding of functional programming principles.
- Hands-on experience with Elixir's powerful pattern matching and recursion.
- Insight into idiomatic Elixir practices.

## Repository Structure

- **`lib/PS.ex`**: Contains the Elixir solutions for the problems, organized by their problem numbers.
- **`test/`**: Includes tests for each solution to ensure correctness.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Problems Solved

So far, the following problems have been solved:

1. [Find the last element of a list](problems/problem_01.ex)
2. [Find the last but one element of a list](problems/problem_02.ex)
3. [Find the Kth element of a list](problems/problem_03.ex)
4. [Find the number of elements in a list](problems/problem_04.ex)
5. [Reverse a list](problems/problem_05.ex)
6. [Find out whether a list is a palindrome](problems/problem_06.ex)
7. [Flatten a nested list structure](problems/problem_07.ex)
8. [Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements](problems/problem_08.ex)
9. [Pack consecutive duplicates into sublists](problems/problem_09.ex)
10. [Run-length encoding of a list](problems/problem_10.ex)
11. [Modified run-length encoding](problems/problem_11.ex)
12. [Decode a run-length encoded list](problems/problem_12.ex)
13. [Direct run-length encoding](problems/problem_13.ex)
14. [Duplicate the elements of a list](problems/problem_14.ex)
15. [Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times](problems/problem_15.ex)
